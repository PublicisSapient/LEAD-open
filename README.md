# LEAD-open
LEAD is our open source approach to talking about Computational Experience with the world. To start, this repository includes a set of icons designed by John Maeda. In the coming months of 2020 we'll be sharing more LEAD resources as well.

## LEAD Iconography
The icons come in three versions: Plain, Bold, and Text (includes the specific L, E, A, D word)

## BONUS: Communications Code of Conduct (CCOC)
Our Toronto office led the creation of our Experience teams' electronic Community Code of Conduct. If you're curious to learn how to model and norm positive digital communities, and you need to customize your own CCOC, visit our Github repo [here](https://github.com/PublicisSapient/ccoc).
