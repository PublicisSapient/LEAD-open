LEAD In A Nutshell

|                                                 | Light                                                        | Ethical                                                      | Accessible                                                   | Dataful                                                      |

| Qualitative and Quantative Keywords and Metrics | Fast, Quick, Speedy, Timely, Cut-Through, Contextual, Smooth, Nimble, Seamless, Focused, Frictionless, Performant | Conscious, Safe, Resonant, Honest, Legitimate, Trustworthy, Transparent, Open, Respectful, Unbiased, Principled, Purposeful | Empathetic, Inclusive, Inviting, Easy, Contextual, Navigable, Compliant, Conforming, Convenient, Clear, Simple, Intuitive | Informed, Accurate, Precise, Insightful, Reliable, Real-time, Continuous, Complete, Comprehensive, Measured, Personalized, Customizable |
| Semiotics Facet                                 | Precise and emotionally resonant sensorial speed affordances. | Open and emotionally resonant sensorial trustworthy affordances. | Remember that most affordances assume an “average” person.   | Adapt sensorial experience to pre-acquired or realtime data. |
| Semantics Facet                                 | Snackable content approach with a clean info architecture.   | Respectful content approach with “open the hood” architecture. | Use the inclusive tones and voices that create the least friction. | Adapt narrative experience to pre-acquired or realtime data. |
| Systems Facet                                   | Reuse what works fast versus inventing just the all new.     | Consider the provenance and policies for all components.     | Incorporate existing and evolving a11y standards at scale.   | Ensure closed loop control can happen at scale and at speed. |
| Science Facet                                   | Keep fast thinking cog sci and basic Gestalt psychology at play. | Lean on unbiased information and processes throughout.       | Examine cognitive physics of onboarding ramp versus loyalty loop. | Incorporate both quality qualitative and quantitative data.  |
| Industries Facet                                | Ensure there is adequate governance of performance budget.   | Weigh the cost/benefits of aligning with the wrong/“right” set of values. | Connect flexibility requirements with contextual ease-of-use. | Use appropriate level of data integration allowed by the sector. |
| Computation Facet                               | Partner with dev and product mgmt on speed x cost prioritizations. | Certify algorithms and ML processing with an inclusion lens. | Take lessons from mobile and spatial computing paradigms.    | Interact with the intent of acquiring material learnings that improve AI. |
